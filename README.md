# 👋 Hey there, I’m João — Data Scientist with a Strategic Mind

With a Master’s degree in Data Science, a background as a Navy officer, and years as an entrepreneur, I combine analytical thinking with tactical discipline. I don't just build models — I solve problems that matter.

I believe in:
- Clarity over complexity
- Strategic insight over blind prediction
- And using data to drive action, not just analysis
