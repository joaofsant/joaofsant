# 🏗️ The Data Forge

*At 40, I decided to restart. This is my forge: where discipline, curiosity and data pipelines meet.*  
Turning raw data into structured, reliable insights — one pipeline at a time.

## ⚡ About Me

I combine **analytical thinking** with the **discipline of execution**.  
My focus is on **data engineering**: designing, automating, and optimizing the flows that make data trustworthy.

## 🔥 Key Projects

🚀 **[Kernelcut – Automated Tech Digest](https://github.com/joaofsant/kernelcut)**  
End-to-end pipeline that ingests multiple RSS feeds, filters and ranks articles, and publishes a daily digest via GitHub Actions + Pages.  
*Stack: Python, Pandas, Parquet, Feedparser, GitHub Actions*  
👉 Live: [kernelcut.com](https://joaofsant.github.io/kernelcut/)

🗂 **[NYC Taxi SQL Optimization](https://github.com/joaofsant/nyc-taxi-sql-optimization)**  
Explored 12.7M NYC taxi rides with DuckDB + SQL-only workflow. Showcases indexing, query optimization, and handling large-scale CSVs efficiently.  
*Stack: SQL, DuckDB, Jupyter, GitHub Pages*

🔍 **[Churn Prediction – Customer Retention Modeling](https://github.com/joaofsant/churn-prediction-project)**  
Supervised learning pipeline with XGBoost, including feature engineering and explainability via SHAP.  
*Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP*

## 📖 Logbook

*A captain’s log, data edition.*

- **2025-09-13** → *“Wrestled with Airflow DAGs. Failed twice, succeeded once. Pipelines are like discipline: fragile if ignored, powerful when maintained.”*  
- **2025-09-07** → *“SQL window functions → finally clicked. They are the telescopes of data analysis: they let you see patterns across the horizon.”*

## ⚡ Insights

⚙️ *A database without indexing is like a life without priorities.*  
🌊 *Data pipelines are rivers: they need flow, cleaning points, and monitoring stations.*  
🧩 *Every bug is a puzzle. Frustration is part of the solution.*
