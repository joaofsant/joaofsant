# 👋 Hey, I’m João — Welcome to The Data Forge

This is my forge: where **discipline, curiosity, and data pipelines meet**.  
I’m building a career in **Data Engineering**, step by step, project by project.  

---

## ⚡ Journey Highlights

- 🛠 Transitioned into tech with a Master’s in Data Science  
- 🗂 Designed **data pipelines** that ingest, clean, and publish information (see Kernelcut project)  
- 📊 Optimized **SQL queries on 12.7M+ NYC taxi rides** using DuckDB  
- 🤖 Built **machine learning models** (XGBoost + SHAP) for churn prediction  
- 🌍 Currently expanding into **Airflow, Spark, and Cloud (AWS/GCP)**

## 📚 Data Engineer Roadmap

*A structured journey from zero → professional pipelines.*

**Month 1 – SQL & Linux**  
👉 [NYC Taxi SQL Optimization](https://github.com/joaofsant/nyc-taxi-sql-optimization)  
Learned query optimization, indexing, and handling millions of rows.  

**Month 2 – Python for Data Engineering**  
Building pipelines with Pandas, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI.  

**Month 3 – Orchestration**  
Airflow + Docker → automated data flows.  

**Month 4 – Big Data & Cloud**  
Spark, AWS S3/Athena, Redshift basics.  

**Month 5 – Streaming & Warehousing**  
Kafka, dimensional modeling, Snowflake/Postgres.  

**Month 6 – MLOps & LLM Foundations**  
Feature stores, model monitoring, RAG pipelines.
